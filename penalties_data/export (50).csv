Specifically, during routine facility operations in the uranium-aluminum line of the Blended Low-enriched Uranium Preparation Facility, nitric acid was added into the bowl cleaning stations which contained small particles of high-enriched uranium scrap material, and the resultant solution produced an unexpectedly high exothermic chemical reaction deforming some of the process piping. The temperatures from the reaction created excess nitrogen compound gases which resulted in the evacuation of the building. Although the failure to have adequate engineered or administrative controls for operations of the bowl cleaning station did not result in any actual personnel exposure consequences in this case, a more significant event could have resulted in a high consequence occupational exposure under different circumstances.

CAN USA, Inc. agreed to a number of corrective actions, including the following: new and specific changes to operating procedures; activities related to training on new and/or revised operating procedures; interim training until the procedures are completed; unannounced audits; additional oversight of radiography crews; and specific written agreements with clients that address radiographic operations. In consideration of these commitments, the NRC agreed to limit the civil penalty amount to $7,000 and not to pursue any further enforcement action in connection with the inspection.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1011/ML101100839.pdf","",""

This enforcement action is based on ten apparent violations of NRC requirements at NIST's facility in Boulder, Colorado, which were identified during NRC inspection and investigation activities conducted in response to a June 9, 2008 plutonium spill. The apparent violations involved the licensee's failure to conduct the radiation safety program at NIST-Boulder in accordance with NRC requirements and the conditions of the NIST-Boulder license. The licensee agreed to take the following actions: (1) complete an independent assessment of the radiation safety program at NIST-Boulder; (2) submit copies of the required annual radiation safety audit to the NRC; (3) develop and implement a procedure for training new employees on radiation safety policies and procedures; (4) upgrade initial and refresher training for employees who work with radioactive materials, including a review of lessons learned from the plutonium spill and the associated apparent violations; (5) submit a license amendment request for deletion of the radionuclides on the NIST-Boulder license that NIST no longer plans to use; (6) develop a formal radiation hazards analysis process; (7) revise the NIST Ionizing Radiation Safety Committee charter to require additional review of NRC submittals; (8) revise the NIST radiation safety program policy to indicate that all individuals interacting with the NRC are required to provide complete and accurate information; (9) develop a clearly defined process for acquiring radioactive materials; and (10) pay a civil penalty of $10,000. In consideration of these commitments, and other actions already completed by NIST, the NRC agreed not to pursue any additional enforcement actions for the apparent violations or count this matter as previous enforcement for the purposes of assessing potential future enforcement actions in accordance with Section VI.C of the Enforcement Policy.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1006/ML100601095.pdf","",""

On August 3, 2010, the S&R president informed the NRC that S&R had transferred its portable moisture density gauge containing radioactive sources to another NRC licensee when S&R still possessed the gauge. The two additional SL III violations involved S&R's failure to afford the NRC an opportunity to inspect materials, activities, and records under the regulations as required by 10 CFR 19.14(a) and S&Rs failure to use a minimum of two independent controls that form tangible barriers to secure portable gauge from unauthorized removal, when the portable gauge was not under S&Rs direct control and constant surveillance as required by 10 CFR 30.34(i). Specifically, on August 3, 2010, S&R provided the NRC inaccurate information about the location of its licensed material, thereby preventing inspection of S&Rs licensed activities and the gauge has been stored inside of its shipping case, which was located in an unlocked closet of the locked S&R office, providing only one barrier.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1201/ML120130332.pdf","",""
