After terminating the contract, CNN hired new employees to perform the same work without recognizing or bargaining with the two unions that had represented the TVS employees. CNN sought to operate as a nonunion workplace and conveyed to the workers that their prior employment with TVS and union affiliation disqualified them from employment.

"MasTec Advanced Technologies","MasTec","MasTec","","$3,120,000","$0","$3,120,000","2022","20220630","employment-related offenses","labor relations violation","","As part of a settlement approved on June 1, 2022, MasTec Advanced Technologies agreed to pay 26 former employees $3.12 million in backpay, interest, and expenses. The dispute began in 2006 when 26 service technicians employed by MasTec, a contractor of DIRECTV, LLC  were fired after reaching out to a local television station and participating in an interview, which was broadcast in the Orlando, Florida area. In the interview, the technicians voiced their frustration with the new pay structure implemented by their employer, which was based upon the technicians' ability to convince customers to agree to a particular installation option. The technicians expressed concern with their supervisors telling them to tell customers whatever it took to convince them to agree and with losing money if they did not convince customers. Region 12-Tampa of the NLRB investigated and tried the case before an Administrative Law Judge. On July 21, 2011, the National Labor Relations Board determined that the employees' participation in the TV interview constituted protected concerted activity. Consequently, it found that by causing the discharge of the technicians for their participation in the newscast, and by discharging them, DIRECTV and MasTec committed unfair labor practices.","federal","agency action","National Labor Relations Board","civil","","","","","","","","","","Florida","","","","","USA","Florida","publicly traded","MTZ","US5763231090","construction and engineering","construction & engineering","https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-wins-312-million-for-unlawfully-fired-workers-in-settlement-with","",""
